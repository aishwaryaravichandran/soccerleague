Techdegree Project 2 for coordinating a town's youth soccer league

This project is to divide 18 players who have signed up for the soccer league into three teams, Sharks, Dragons and Raptors.
Each team must have same number of players and also each team must have equal experienced players.
After dividing them, a file named 'teams.txt' is created with all three teams and the information about the assigned players.
Seperate Welcome letters (text files) are created to each player's guardians.
